Using near-infrared light, fNIRS allows researchers to non-invasively monitor hemodynamic responses in the brain, offering insight into localized brain activity. The fNIRS system in our lab can simultaneously measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations from multiple optodes positioned on the scalp. This enables the exploration of neural dynamics in both task-related and naturalistic environments, complementing other behavioral and physiological measures such as eye tracking and motion capture.\n\nTechnical details\nThe lab is located in McGuinn 405D\n\nSystem Features: The Brite24 system measures, stores, and wirelessly transmits up to 27 channels of fNIRS signals. Channels can be configured for large regions of the scalp or subdivided into smaller regions, offering flexibility:\n\nConfigurations:\n\nSingle large region: 27 channels\nCombinations of smaller regions: 2×12 channels, 2×10 + 2 short channels, or 4×4 + 2 short channels.\n\nOptode Setup: The system uses 10 transmitters and 8 receivers that fit into a full-head cap with 64+ optode positions, allowing for extensive placement customization.\nHead Cap Options: The lab is equipped with three cap sizes (small, medium, and large) to accommodate different head sizes.\n\nSynchronization Capabilities:\nThe PortaSync wireless device integrates seamlessly with the Brite24 system, enabling synchronization with other instruments. It can generate dual signal levels, corresponding to different event types, which are recorded alongside fNIRS data.\nSoftware:\n\nOxySoft: Used for data collection, storage, and analysis, OxySoft provides real-time and parallel recording of multiple devices. It offers customizable configurations for individual research needs and supports online visualization and analysis.\nEMSE Suite: This modular system includes tools such as the Data Editor Module, which supports filtering, transformation, and detailed time-series analysis.\n\n\nThis versatile setup allows researchers to design experiments with exceptional precision, synchronize multimodal datasets, and analyze neural activity across a variety of contexts and conditions."
